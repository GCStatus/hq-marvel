### Live Demo: https://hq-marvel.gcstatus.cloud

## ‚ú® Features

#### Advanced Filtering & Sorting: Allows users to filter and sort records by title, date, format, and more, with debounced inputs for a responsive experience.

#### Declarative, Hardware-Accelerated Animations: Leverages the full power of Framer Motion for all UI animations, from complex 3D card tilts to elegant page transitions and staggered list reveals.

#### Rich, Interactive UI: Features beautifully designed, interactive cards for Comics, Creators, Events, and Series, each with unique hover effects and animations.

#### Detailed Dossier Pages: Every character, comic, series, event, and story has a dedicated detail page with a unique, thematic design.
